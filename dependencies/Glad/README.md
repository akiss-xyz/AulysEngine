au-glad - A 'fork' of Glad (https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) used in the Aulys Engine
=====================================================================================

Modifications:
--------------

- Added a premake5.lua file to allow it to build with our build system.
- The build folder.

If I changed some of the source and forgot, hopefully I'll eventually realise and tell you about it.

License:
--------

The same as the original, the MIT license.
